# Searching for odd transcripts and novel lncRNAs in the SRA

## lncRNAs

### We downloaded sequences of lncRNAs from lncipedia

#### https://lncipedia.org/downloads/lncipedia_5_2/full-database/lncipedia_5_2.fasta

#### made a blast database using standard commands (including -parse_seqids 

#### then BLASTed contigs into the our lncRNA database

#### We found several lncRNAs that were prominently expressed in the SRA
